Grocr helps people save money on their recurring grocery costs.

Tell Grocr the things you buy often (milk, eggs, bread, Coca-Cola) and it will tell you the nearest grocery store with the current lowest prices.

Grocr keeps up to date on all the latest sales, so you don't need to check the weekly flyer anymore.
