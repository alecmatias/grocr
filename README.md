Grocr was a simple project that [mbegley](https://github.com/mbegley), [alecmatias](https://github.com/alecmatias), and I did for the inaugural Code Fellows bootcamp. It is a simple app that allows users to register and pick items from a catalogue in order to add them to a wish list.

User authentication is done with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise). The app uses [Zurb Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) for UI.

This repo is my personal fork of the original class project.

Original Readme:
=====
> Grocr helps people save money on their recurring grocery costs.
>
> Tell Grocr the things you buy often (milk, eggs, bread, Coca-Cola) and it will tell you the nearest grocery store with the current lowest prices.
>
> Grocr keeps up to date on all the latest sales, so you don't need to check the weekly flyer anymore.
